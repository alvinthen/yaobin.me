Finally I got my blog up, so let's just fill this in with my resolutions for 2018

* ~~Setup this blog~~ (Okay I cheated, this is from around ending of last year)
* Quality content at least once every fortnight
* Go diving
* Get a motorbike license
* At least once backpacking
* Get all associate level certification from AWS
* Sleep earlier, like before 12am
* Find victim to practice coaching skill
* Read and read, and read
* Lose weight (this has to stay every year, no?)
